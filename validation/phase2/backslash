/*
 *	'\\' has a special meaning on phase 2 if and only if it is immediately
 * followed by '\n'.  In any other position it's left alone as any other
 * character.
 *
 * [5.1.1.2(1.2)]:
 *   Each instance of a backslash character (\) immediately followed by
 *   a new-line character is deleted, splicing physical source lines to
 *   form logical source lines.  Only the last backslash on any physical
 *   source line shall be eligible for being part of such a splice.
 *   A source file that is not empty shall end in a new-line character,
 *   which shall not be immediately preceded by a backslash character
 *   before any such splicing takes place.
 *
 * Note that this happens on the phase 2, before we even think of any
 * tokens.  In other words, splicing is ignorant of and transparent for
 * the rest of tokenizer.
