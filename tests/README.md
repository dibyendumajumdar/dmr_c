# Tests for Sparse-LLVM backend

The tests in the sub folders are for validating the LLVM backend for Sparse. Each test can be compiled and run

The tests in the picoc folder are adapted from the picoc project.

## Running tests

All tests can be compiled and run individually. Tests should return 0 on successful execution. Some tests require output to be checked.
