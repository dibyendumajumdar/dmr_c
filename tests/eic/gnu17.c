Subject: Optimizer bug in gcc 1.x

I found the cause of the optimizer bug that I've been sending you.  It
occurs because you scan for the first and last occurances of registers
before common subexpression processing, but cse can change these
occurances.  The bug appears in the example program because loop
optimization removes a load of "mem" into a pseudo-register, because
based on the information of the register scan it thinks that there are
no more appearances of the pseudo-register.  Cse added a reference,
however, and this information is not placed in regno_last_uid[].  The
solution seems to be to call reg_scan() again after calling
cse_main().  It fixed the bug anyway, and didn't seem to cause
anything bad.

Diffs for the fix, and the original sample program follow.
