The tests here are taken from the [lcc](https://github.com/drh/lcc) project.

Some tests have been disabled:

* s7813 fails to compile - the linearized code appears to be incorrect.
* Some other tests are still to be adapted to work with sparse as these use initializers that are not currently supported.
