# Tests for Sparse-LLVM backend

The tests in the sub folders are for validating the LLVM backend for Sparse. Each test can be compiled and run

The tests in the picoc folder are adapted from the picoc project.

## Running tests

Sorry there is no driver yet.
All tests can be compiled and run individually.
There are two types of tests:

* The tests in set1 folder return non-zero on failure.
* The tests in picoc and avltree generate output which must be compared with the expected output.
